## 🏁 THE DESTINATION (Year 5 - The Exit)
**The Goal:** The "Millionaire's Professional Unique App".
*   **State:** Fully Autonomous.

## 🔙 STEP 4: THE FRANCHISE (Year 3)
*   **State:** White-Label Distribution.
*   **Function:** We sell the *code* (The JSON Keys) to other consultants.
*   **Requirement:** The system must be "detachable" and "injectable" (Completed in v2.5).

---

## 🔙 STEP 3: THE WORKSTATION (Year 1 - CURRENT FOCUS)
*   **State:** Service-Based Scale.
*   **Function:** A human (You or an Employee) operates the machine.
*   **The Workflow:**
    1.  **AIin5** captures the lead in the store. **(UPDATED: Now saves to Admin Dashboard)**
    2.  The Lead books a time on the **Calendar**.
    3.  The **Service Rep** logs into the **BOSS Workstation**.
    4.  Rep uses **Screen Share + Highlighter** to demo the product. **(UPDATED: High-DPI Crisp Mode)**
*   **Key Tech:** Real-time canvas drawing, video uplink, centralized calendar, Local LLM Support (Llama).

## 🔙 STEP 2: THE STOREFRONT (Month 6)
*   **State:** The "Pop-Up" Shop.
*   **Function:** A beautiful, glass-morphism interface to sell GIFs (or any digital asset).
*   **Status:** **COMPLETE.** (Cart, Wrapping Lab, Checkout are functional).

## 📝 DAILY LOG: CLEANUP & UPDATES

**[Current Sprint: BOSS VdM v1.02]**
*   **Objective:** Solidify the "Hub & Warehouse" Architecture.
*   **Major Upgrade:**
    1.  **Tactical Geo-Map:** Added a visual map interface to the **Universal Broadcaster** (Marketing Tab). You can now select zones (e.g., Paradise Valley) visually to target blasts.
    2.  **Architecture Confirmation:** 
        *   **BOSS Hub:** The Admin Dashboard is the central warehouse.
        *   **AIin5:** The Recruiter/Sales Agent living in the store.
        *   **CRM:** The internal rolodex.
    3.  **Modular Sales Strategy:** Confirmed that the CRM/Marketing modules are "detachable" via License Tiers, allowing us to market them separately if needed.

**[Next Steps]**
*   Test the "Lead" saving mechanism by talking to the bot.
*   Verify the canvas drawing feels smooth on a phone touch screen.
*   **Owners Manual:** Ensure the "Map Targeting" feature is documented for the end-user.
