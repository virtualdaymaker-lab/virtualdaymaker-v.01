## 🟢 START HERE: WHAT IS THIS? (Layman's Terms)

Forget the technical jargon. Here is exactly what this system is:

**It is a "Digital House" for your business or life.**
Most websites are like brochures—you just look at them. **GIF.OS** is like a house. You can walk inside, store your files in the safe, open the shop, and have a robot butler (AI) do work for you.

### The 4 Products You Can Turn This Into:

1.  **The Pop-Up Store (Starter)**
    *   *What it is:* A digital cash register.
    *   *Who it's for:* Someone selling t-shirts, holiday gifts, or digital art.
    *   *What it does:* Shows products, takes money, sends receipts. Simple.

2.  **The Business Command Center (Enterprise)**
    *   *What it is:* An office dashboard.
    *   *Who it's for:* Small business owners.
    *   *What it does:* It has a calendar for marketing, a list of all your sales, and a robot (AI) that can write emails for you.

3.  **The Digital Twin (Personal AI)**
    *   *What it is:* A digital diary that talks back.
    *   *Who it's for:* Influencers, executives, or anyone who wants to leave a legacy.
    *   *What it does:* You upload your journals and voice notes. The AI learns how you speak and think, becoming a "backup" of your mind.

4.  **The Smart Home Manual (Estate)**
    *   *What it is:* A user manual for a house.
    *   *Who it's for:* AirBnB hosts, Luxury Real Estate Agents.
    *   *What it does:* You take photos of receipts and appliance manuals. The system stores them. If a pipe bursts, you scan a QR code to call the plumber immediately.

## 🔑 REQUIRED KEYS & SETUP (The "Utilities")

Just like a real house needs electricity and water, this digital house needs **API Keys** to run.

### 1. The Brain (AI Intelligence)
*   **What it does:** Powers the Chatbot (AIin5), writes emails, and organizes data.
*   **Key Needed:** **Google Gemini API Key**.
*   **Cost:** **Free** (The "Flash" model we use is free-tier eligible).
*   **Where to put it:** Go to **Admin Dashboard -> Bot Tab -> Slot 1**.
*   **Get it here:** [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

### 2. The Bank (Payments)
*   **What it does:** Allows you to accept Credit Cards or PayPal. Without this, the checkout is in "Demo Mode".
*   **Key Needed:** **Stripe Publishable Key** OR **PayPal Client ID**.
*   **Cost:** Free to get the key. You only pay a small % when you actually sell something.
*   **Where to put it:** Go to **Admin Dashboard -> System Tab -> API Keys**.

### 3. The Map (Optional)
*   **What it does:** Shows high-tech street maps in the Marketing Tab.
*   **Key Needed:** Google Maps Javascript API.
*   **Note:** You do **NOT** need this to start. The system uses "Inferred Location" (Zip Codes) for free. Only get this if you need zoomable street views.

## 📅 THE 3-5-7 YEAR PLAN (Survival Guide)

This software is designed to evolve. Here is your roadmap to stay relevant without needing to be a code expert.

### Year 1-3: The "Builder" Phase (Manual Customization)
*   **Action:** You take this code, customize it for a specific client (e.g., Luxury Villa), and sell it for a high fee ($5k+).
*   **Update Strategy:** You keep the core code (the "Shell"). When a new client comes, you load a saved Template.

### Year 3-5: The "Franchise" Phase (Selling Templates)
*   **Action:** Instead of building for clients, you sell the **Design Files** to other developers.
*   **Update Strategy:** If technology shifts (e.g., VR becomes popular), you update the Shell once, and all your old templates still work inside it.

### Year 7+: The "Hardware" Phase (Integration)
*   **Action:** The software moves off laptops and onto wall-mounted screens in smart homes.
*   **Update Strategy:** The system becomes part of the house's architecture.

## 🎥 MARKETING FOR NON-MARKETERS

If you hate selling yourself, let the software do it.

**New Feature: "Marketing Demo Simulator"**
1.  Go to **Admin -> System**.
2.  Click **"SIMULATE SUCCESS"**.
3.  The dashboard will instantly fill with fake, impressive data (High Sales, Verified Contractors, AI Analysis).
4.  **Screen Record this.** Post the video.
5.  You don't need to speak. The visual proves the value.

## 🧸 THE "BUILD-A-BEAR" STRATEGY (For Consultants)

**You do not build the same thing twice.** Use this workflow to scale your business:

### 1. The Workshop (Construction Mode)
Start with your personal copy of the app. This is your "Workshop".
*   **Customize It:** Add the client's colors, upload their Virtual Tour link, set the AI's personality.
*   **Verify It:** Make sure everything looks perfect.

### 2. The Blueprint (Save Template)
Once the "Bear" is built, save it.
1.  Go to **Admin -> System**.
2.  Look for **"Template Manager"**.
3.  Click **"Save Current Design"**.
4.  This downloads a file (e.g., `Luxury_Villa_Template.json`). This is your product.

### 3. The Injection (Deployment)
When you have a new client:
1.  Open a fresh version of the app.
2.  Go to **Admin -> System -> Load Design File**.
3.  Upload the JSON file. *Boom.* The app instantly transforms into the finished product.

### 4. The Handover (Clean & Detach)
1.  Click **"DETACH SYSTEM"** (The Red Button).
2.  This wipes *your* passwords and "cleans" the bear for the new owner.
3.  Send them the link. They verify their phone number and it becomes *theirs*.

## 🔐 5. THE HANDOVER PROTOCOL (Chain of Custody)

This feature is critical for Consultants selling this system. It allows you to build the product, save it, wipe your personal traces, and hand it to the client securely.

### Phase 1: Export Identity (The "Soul")
Before you wipe the system, you must save the configuration.
1.  Go to **Admin Dashboard > System**.
2.  Click **"Export Identity Key"**.
3.  This downloads a `.json` file containing:
    *   The Theme (Colors, Fonts).
    *   The License Tier (Enterprise, Estate, etc.).
    *   The VPN Configuration.
    *   **The Active Logo (Base64).**
    *   *Note: It does NOT save your private Payment Keys for security.*

### Phase 2: System Detach (The "Wipe")
1.  In **Admin Dashboard > System**, scroll to the Red Zone.
2.  Check the waivers (confirming you have removed keys and saved your backup).
3.  Click **"Execute Detach Protocol"**.
4.  **Result:** The screen goes black/dark. The system is now an empty shell (Bootloader Mode). It has forgotten you.

### Phase 3: The Rebirth (Client Activation)
This is what your client does when they receive the system.
1.  Send the URL to your client.
2.  They will see the **"System Boot"** screen.
3.  **Option A (Identity Key):** They drag-and-drop the `.json` Identity Key you sent them. The system "Boots up" with your design, but empty data.
4.  **Option B (Quick Start):** If demoing, click **"Manual Override"** to force a boot with factory settings.

## 🌐 6. THE HUB & SPOKE MODEL (Architecture)

This is the advanced operational model for running multiple stores or clients.

### The Question: "Where does AIin5 fit?"
**AIin5 lives IN the Store, but it reports TO the Hub.**

### The Workflow: "Selling the Store"

1.  **The Hook (The Store):**
    *   A visitor comes to a Client Store (e.g., "Holiday Gift Shop").
    *   The **AIin5 Widget** (floating orb) asks: *"Do you like this store? I can build one for you in 5 minutes."*
    *   The visitor says "Yes". The AI captures their email as a Lead.

2.  **The Build (The Hub):**
    *   You (The Consultant) receive the lead in your **BOSS Hub**.
    *   You open your local machine, configure a new store template, and export the `.json`.

3.  **The Handover (The Session):**
    *   You meet the client on Zoom.
    *   You send them a link to a **Fresh VdM Instance**.
    *   You send them the `.json` file you generated.
    *   They upload it. The store "boots up" instantly.

### Why this is smart:
*   **Security:** The client never touches your Hub. They only get the specific file you exported.
*   **Speed:** You don't build from scratch. You pull from your inventory.
*   **Sales:** The store sells itself via the embedded AI widget.

## 📘 TECHNICAL USER MANUAL (For the Owner)

### 🚀 1. Unlocking Your System

When you first receive the link from your consultant, the screen will be locked.

1.  **Verify Identity**: Enter your Phone Number or Email. This becomes the "Owner Key".
2.  **Choose Your Package**: Select which version you bought (Starter, Enterprise, etc.).
3.  **Set Password**: Create a Vault Password. *Do not lose this.*

### 🤖 2. Using the AI (SEP)

The system comes with a smart assistant named **SEP**.
*   **Talk to it:** Go to the "Command" tab and type "Write a sale post for Instagram."
*   **Train it:** Go to "Intelligence" and tell it "You are a professional assistant" or "You are a funny roaster."

### 🛠 3. The Dashboard Tools

*   **Commerce:** See who bought your stuff.
*   **Marketing:** Drag-and-drop a calendar to plan your social media.
*   **Reality Scanner (Estate Mode):** Open this on your phone. Take a picture of a paper receipt. The system reads the numbers and saves it digitally.
*   **Drone Uplink:** If you have a property video, upload it here to see a high-tech aerial view.

### 📦 Installation (For Developers Only)

1.  **Drop into Editor**: Unzip the folder into VS Code.
2.  **Install**: Run `npm install` in the terminal.
3.  **Start**: Run `npm run dev` to launch the local server.
